# Prediction-heartattack
Prediction of chances of having heart attack based on different feature using classification algorithm
-This dataset is taken from kaggle
-Here I have to do prediction of chances of a person having heart disease as yes or no.
-Target column is given as 0 or 1 ,0 means  no chances of having heart attack, 1 means chances of having heart attack.
-total 13 features are given which is  label column.
-DIfferent classification  algorithm we have used and predicted accuracy of each model
logistic Regression	86.341463
Naive Bayes	85.365854
Random Forest	93.658537
Extreme Gradient Boost	91.219512
K-Nearest Neighbour	87.804878
Decision Tree	94.634146
Support Vector Machine	98.048780
As we can see among all svm gives the highest accuracy of prediction.
